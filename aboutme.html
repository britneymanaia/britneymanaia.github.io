            My name is Britney Manaia and I grew up in Palmerston North. I have one sibling who is extremely annoying and always gets up in my business. As cliche as it sounds, my favourite food is pizza. I've had a pretty chilled life, nothing dramatic has really happened, but it gets kind of boring. I've lived with only 3 pets: 2 birds and 1 dog whom we love to bits. I barely ever have any free time as I am either training, umpiring or helping out with netball. All I ever do is listen to music as I don't particularly like the silence. I'm the type of person who would be there for anyone, doesn't matter who they are.
